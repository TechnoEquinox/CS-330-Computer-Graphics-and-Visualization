# CS-330-Computer-Graphics-and-Visualization

This repo was the major assignment for my CS 330: Computer Graphics and Visualization class at Southern New Hampshire University. This project was completed in C++ for OpenGL.

1. How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software begins with breaking down complex ideas into manageable, modular components. Through this project, I developed stronger skills in visual design planning, such as mapping 2D concepts into 3D space and considering user interaction from the beginning. I followed a structured design process by identifying the key shapes needed, planning transformations, and iteratively refining the layout. These tactics—especially modular thinking and visual planning—will be valuable in future software projects involving UI/UX or game development.
   
2. How do I approach developing programs?

While building the 3D scene, I adopted new development strategies like isolating transformations, leveraging reusable helper functions, and using abstraction to manage scene complexity. Iteration played a major role—each milestone allowed me to improve lighting, interactivity, and object detail through testing and feedback. Over time, my coding approach became more deliberate and maintainable, especially with the addition of keyboard controls and camera logic that helped structure the code more clearly. This evolution taught me to treat each feature as part of a larger system rather than a standalone task.
 
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

This class has deepened my understanding of 3D space, lighting models, and camera logic—skills that will support me in advanced graphics or game development coursework. Professionally, these experiences expand my capabilities in fields like simulation, augmented reality, or interactive design, where real-time visual feedback is crucial. This project also taught me how to problem-solve through visual logic, a transferable skill in any software development environment.
